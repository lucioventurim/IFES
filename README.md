# IFES - Applied Computing - AI

This is a framework developed for experiments with bearing faults data sets to evaluate classification models and mitigate similarity bias.
It is part of the dissertation for a Master's degree on Applied Computing on Artificial Intelligence at IFES - Instituto Federal do Esp√≠rito Santo - Serra - Brazil.

# Data sets

The following data sets are covered in this framework:

- CWRU (from Case Western Reserve University)
- MFPT (from Mechanical Failures Prevention Group)
- PADERBORN (from the Chair of Design and Drive Technology, Paderborn University, Germany)
- OTTAWA (from the Mechanical Department of the University of Ottawa)

# Requirements

This framework was developed in Python 3.8, using PyCharm IDE.

In order to run this framework, the following packages are required, which are listed in the requirements.txt file:

- patool==1.12
- pip-chill==1.0.1
- pyunpack==0.2.2
- rarfile==4.0
- scikit-learn
- tensorflow
- numpy~=1.19.2
- PyWavelets

Also, for the PADERBORN data set, it is required a compatible unrar software installed to extract the data set files.

# Instructions

Here are the steps to perform experiments using this framework:

- Define if the esperiments will use GPU or not, changing the use_gpu flag.
- Choose which classification models will be evaluated on the clfs list on main().
- Choose the splitting strategy for the experiments on the splits list on main(). Here each data set has different possible splitting strategies.
- Define the number of experiments to be performed on main().
- Define which data set will be used, on the dataset variable on main().

After the experiments execution, the csv files will be available with the results.

In order to view the results again in the future, there is the main_read file. On this file, change the csv file name on metrics.scores on main() to show the results.

# Folders and Files Description

The main framework folders and files are listed below:

- classification_models: Folder with the classification models available for evaluation
-- Models available: CNN, FaultNet, KNN, LR, MLP, Random Forest, SVM
