# IFES - Applied Computing - AI

This is a framework developed for experiments with bearing faults data sets to evaluate classification models and mitigate similarity bias.
It is part of the dissertation for a Master's degree on Applied Computing on Artificial Intelligence at IFES - Instituto Federal do Esp√≠rito Santo - Serra - Brazil.

# Data sets

The following data sets are covered in this framework:

- CWRU (from Case Western Reserve University)
- MFPT (from Mechanical Failures Prevention Group)
- PADERBORN (from the Chair of Design and Drive Technology, Paderborn University, Germany)
- OTTAWA (from the Mechanical Department of the University of Ottawa)

# Requirements

This framework was developed in Python 3.8, using PyCharm IDE.

In order to run this framework, the following packages are required, which are listed in the requirements.txt file:

- patool==1.12
- pip-chill==1.0.1
- pyunpack==0.2.2
- rarfile==4.0
- scikit-learn
- tensorflow
- numpy~=1.19.2
- PyWavelets

Also, for the PADERBORN data set, it is required a compatible unrar software to extract the data set files.
